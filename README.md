Netflix data exploration (work in progress)

This repo is actively being built.
I’m building this project step by step to simulate a real DS workflow. Here’s what’s done and what’s coming next:
[x] Created GitHub repo & initial README
[x]  Imported CSVs with pd.read_csv()
[ ]  Ran initial EDA (head, info, describe, null checks)
[ ]  Built quick plots (top genres, ratings distribution)
[ ]  Wrote SQL-style queries (joins, groupbys, aggregations)
[ ]  Applied statistical analysis (t-test, ANOVA, guardrails)
[ ]  Designed dashboard / visual storytelling (Plotly or Streamlit)
[ ]  Final write-up with insights + polished portfolio
