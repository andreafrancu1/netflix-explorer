Netflix data exploration (work in progress)

This repo is actively being built.
I’m building this project step by step to simulate a real DS workflow. Here’s what’s done and what’s coming next:

- [x] Create GitHub repo & initial README
- [x]  Import CSVs with pd.read_csv()
- [x]  Run initial EDA (head, info, describe, null checks)
- [x]  Check for and handle duplicate and missing data
- [ ]  Build quick plots (top genres, ratings distribution)
- [ ]  Write SQL-style queries (joins, groupbys, aggregations)
- [ ]  Apply statistical analysis (t-test, ANOVA, guardrails)
- [ ]  Design dashboard / visual storytelling (Plotly or Streamlit)
- [ ]  Final write-up with insights + polished portfolio
